Jodd Site
=========

This repo contains [Jodd Site](http://jodd.org) and **Documentation**.

Documentation is written in **kramdown**.

Static site is build using our own, custom builder.
We figured that the most important thing about static site generation
is to have good markdown extension, and we find **kramdown** the best.
Generation, templates, macros - all that was easy and, more important,
fast to develop.
