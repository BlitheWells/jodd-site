# What's comming next?

## Next Release

We continue to improve things... 3.4.5 comes with some important fixes and improvements.

We are also updating our documentation... so please be patient :)

Stay tuned!


## Code coverage increase

We have one simple rule: '_just increase code coverage by **1%**_'. We are constantly increasing code coverage by writing more testcases. Even if the increase is small, it is still a _good thing_ to do.
